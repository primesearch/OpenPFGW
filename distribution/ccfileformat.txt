Synapsis:

The CC format is used for Cunningham Chains

****************************************************************************

File References:

This format is similar to the ABC format so familiarize yourself with that format
before reading further.

There are some key differences between the CC and ABC formats.  They are:

  1)  The first line has the format kind,length,expression where:
         kind = 1 or 2 with 1 = Cunningham Chain of the first kind
         length = the length of the Cunningham Chain
         expression = an ABC formatted expression for the first term of the chain
  2)  The expression does support the $a, $b, etc. variables
  3)  The expression does not support (&) or (|)
  4)  number_primes and number_comps are not supported
  
At runtime pfgw will use the kind and length to generate all expressions to be
evaluated.  As we are testing for Cunningham Chains, pfgw will use the & condition
for all generated expressions.

Here are some examples:
   CC 1,3,$a*2^50000-1

   This will generate the expressions:
      $a*2^50000-1
      2*($a*2^50000-1)+1
      4*($a*2^50000-1)+3

   CC 2,6,$a*7877#+1

   This will generate the expressions:
      $a*7877#+1
      2*($a*7877#+1)-1
      4*($a*7877#+1)-3
      8*($a*7877#+1)-7
      16*($a*7877#+1)-15
      32*($a*7877#+1)-31

All of the generated expressions must be PRP (or prime) for this to be a Cunningham Chain.
If any are composite, it will skip to the next $a value in the first.

If all of the terms in the Cunningham Chain are prime you will see "- Complete Set -" in pfgw.log.

Note that a Cunningham Chain of type 1 and length 2 are also known as Sophie-Germain primes.

This format is generated by the ccsieve program from the mtsieve framework.

If you find a new Cunningham Chain record, the Top 5000 website at https://primes.utm.edu/
requires you to report the largest prime of the chain.  This means that you need to take
the k reported in pfgw.log and multiply by 2^n, the last k value in the log before the
"- Complete set" - line.  To put it more simply if the last line before "- Complete Set -"
is 8*(13720852541*7877#-1)+7, then submit 109766820328*7877#-1 to the Top 5000 website and 
mark with the comment "Cunningham Chain (8p+7)".  You will notice the similarity between
this comment and what you see in pfgw.log.
