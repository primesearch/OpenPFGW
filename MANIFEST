GMP if needed. Note if it is needed, you must conform to the LGPL, and
include source code, plus the ability for a user to rebuild it and use
it with pfgw.

Developers should modify these files as required during the development
process. In addition, developers should supply entries for the NEWS file.
New NEWS items will be added to the top of this file. NEWS items should be
readable by an end-user. They do not reflect detail levels in the ChangeLog.
