The following changes were made from Phil Carmody's original
distributions in order to fall in line with the other openpfgw
components and allow VPATH builds:

1) All Makefiles called as part of the build of prmsieve.a have
been moved to Makefile.old and replaced by Makefile.in and a
configuration script.

2) Makedefs has also been moved to Makedefs.old and is built by
configuration.

3) A full set of configuration requirements is added to these
directories (config.sub, config.guess, install-sh).

4) The header file "prmsieve.h" produced a path-search conflict
with the openpfgw project file of the same name. It's been renamed
to prmsieve_local.h to see if this is indeed the issue.
