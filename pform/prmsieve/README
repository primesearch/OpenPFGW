PRMSIEVE suite, part of the OpenPFGW project.

Prime Sieving Utilities

- Atkins sieve, based totally on Bernstein's primegen 
  Like primegen, but nearly twice as fast once you're up to 10^12
- Windowed Eratosthenes sieve, based heavily on Bernstein's eratspeed
  Includes a 'modular' feature, to only return primes of the form
  ax+b for coprime a,b.
- Fixed Small Prime Table Compression, home grown.
  Need a hundred thousand primes, don't store them as a list, compress and 
  decompress to make your program source and executable smaller.


Usage Terms:
As in the OpenPFGW terms with the following notes.
Use my code freely (as in love), distribute my code freely (as in beer),
modify my code freely (as in BSD). However, feel a moral obligation to 
acknowledge the source of the code. If the changes you make to remove
references to the original authors are more than the changes you've made 
to the source - you're doing a /bad thing/.
