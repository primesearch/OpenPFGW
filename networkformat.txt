PFGW can now support networking using TCP/IP (only in the Win32 executable)

To use this feature simply write a file of this format:
NETWORK
<host>
<port>
<lines of work to buffer>

eg:
NETWORK
127.0.0.1
12984
100

The protocol is very simple.  Once PFGW has connected to a server it sends
"GN <number of expressions it wants>" to the server.  eg. "GN 100".  It then
expects a list of expresions back, separated by carriage returns - it may be
any number of expressions up to the requested number.  If any are prime then
it will return "PR <expression>".  If it does not test an expression then it
sends "ND <expression>" (this is only sent when PFGW is exited using Ctrl-C).
It does not confirm expressions are composite to save on bandwidth, but this
may change in the future if anyone feels it is necessary.

A very basic server is available on the Yahoogroups site, feel free to make
your own, mail me if you want any more details (mdb36@cam.ac.uk).
